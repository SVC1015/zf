      <h1> <u> Core Values </u></h1> 
      <ol>
      <li> <strong>Honesty: </strong>When I was younger I lied, a lot. My dad made it very clear to me that if I ever had the reputation as a liar, it would be impossible to find success in any part of life. To me, being honest is more than telling the truth. It's an understanding of who you are and being able to genuinely share that to the world and not fearing the consequences. </li> 
      <li> <strong>Balance: </strong> I believe balance to be the ability to understand what is most important to you and create systems that allow you to be your best at it every day. For me, this includes: family, relationships, job, exercise, and trying to make people healthier and happier. My day is a success when I spend every waking moment thinking about these things, and design my day to spend time focusing on all of these categories. </li>
      <li> <strong>Gratitude: </strong> I'm the luckiest kid in the world. Since the day I was born, I have lived a damn near perfect life that most of the time does not feel real. I've never had to worry about having a roof over my head or where my next meal is coming from. My family and friends are the most incredible support system. It is possible that one day, this all may come crashing down. This is why gratitude is so important to me. The pursuit of appreciating what I have is a lifelong journey that I am committed to.  </li>
      <li> <strong>Devotion: </strong> To me, devotion is finding people, projects, and journeys that you want to pour your entire self into. Because of this process, I would not say I'm devoted to many things. I'm very honest with myself on what my devotions are. I've been devoted to the game of baseball since I was 5 years old. The day I emailed you was the day that I realized that I have to devote myself to something much bigger. </li>
    </ol>

  <section class="why-section">
      <h1> <u>Why I'm Looking For a New Opportunity?</u> </h1> 
      <p><ol>
        <li> <strong>Fulfillment: </strong>As  I mentioned in my original e-mail to you, working in professional baseball is something that no longer excites me. As I grow older, I realize there are companies and individuals who are in a great position to change the world. These are the people I want to surround myself with. </li> 
        <li> <strong> Find deep work: </strong> My job consists of me talking to players and our analysts about baseball concepts and stats, which at this point does not require deep thinking and is rarely a struggle. I'm looking for an opportunity that forces me to learn daily, fail constantly, and be rewarded for my work ethic.  </li> 
        <li> <strong> Maximize my potential: </strong>  I'm 26 years old, hungry as hell, and can not spend more of my time staying in the same industry. Our time on earth is finite (for now), I need to start making the most of my time here.  </li>
