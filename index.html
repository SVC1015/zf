<h1> Life (through 26.5 years)</h1>

      <h2> Birth</h2>
      <p>Born in Miami, FL. Parents met at University of Miami. Mom was a registered nurse and my dad still practices as an ENT doctor.

      <h2>Growing Up</h2>
      <p>Attended Pine Crest School for 14 years. PC is an "elite" college prep school. Although tuition was overpriced, I am grateful for my classmates, many of which will be my closest friends for the rest of my life.</p>

      <h2>College</h2>
      <p>Attended Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA to continue my education and play baseball. The Lehigh experience was ok at best, the circle I ran in was heavily influenced by partying and alcohol. However, I did meet my girlfriend there who I plan to spend the rest of my life with!</p>

      <h2>Early Career </h2>
      <p>My goal in life was to either be a MLB general manager or a talent agent. Within two years of graduating from college, I worked for a team and agency. I quickly realized my "dream jobs" stifle creativity, suppress young voices, and make it difficult to have the family dynamic that I wish to have.</p>

      <h2>Next Chapter</h2>
      <p>In my next chapter, I hope to be pushed outside of my comfort zone with meaningful work that allows me be surrounded by genuinely good people. </p>

  <div class="container right">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Future</h2>
      <p>If I had to guess, within five years I'll have a family of my own. When the time comes, it is very important for me to have a career that allows me to provide for my family while allowing me the opportunity to be the best father, husband, son, brother possible.</p>
